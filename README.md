# JHipster Artwork

## About

The original JHipster logo was created by [Guillaume Gaulard](https://twitter.com/ggaulard). The current JHipster logos were designed by Julie Libralato, and paid by the JHipster project through our [Open Collective account](https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster). Many thanks to our [sponsors](https://www.jhipster.tech/sponsors/), without their support and money this would not have been possible!

## What's available in this repository?

This repository contains:

- The JHipster [Graphical charter](JHipster-graphical-charter.pdf), which explains how the JHipster artwork should be used.
- The [logos](logos/) directory contains the current JHipster logos.
- The [icons](icons/) directory contains the current JHipster icons.
- The [family](family/) directory contains the JHipster "family members". As explained in the next section, our goal is to make this family grow, don't hesitate to contribute!
- The [old](old/) directory contains the old JHipster images and logos, which should not be used anymore.

## The JHipster Family

Here's some examples of the JHipster family members.

## Inclusiveness

As with all JHipster projects, the JHipster Artwork project follows the [JHipster code of conduct](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). One of our goals is to have inclusive artwork: at the moment the "JHipster family" has a few members, but the idea is that this family grows, with many different members, as expressed in our code of conduct. If you want to help the project, you can either participate as an artist (the source files from all images are available in this repository) or as a sponsor (so we can pay an artist to create those new images).

All images are validated by [Audrey Neveu](https://twitter.com/Audrey_Neveu), who is well-known in the Java community for her involvement in [Devoxx4Kids](http://www.devoxx4kids.org/) and [Duchess France](https://www.duchess-france.org/).

## Logos and images usage

All logos and images are available under the [Apache 2 license](LICENSE.txt), and belong to the JHipster project.
