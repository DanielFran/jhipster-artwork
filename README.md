# JHipster Artwork

__THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT USE THOSE FILES FOR THE MOMENT__

## About

The original JHipster logo was created by [Guillaume Gaulard](https://twitter.com/ggaulard). The current JHipster logos were designed by Julie LIBRALATO, and paid by the JHipster project through our [Open Collective account](https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster). Many thanks to our [sponsors](https://www.jhipster.tech/sponsors/), without their support and money this would not have been possible!

## Inclusiveness

As all JHipster projects, the JHipster Artwork project follows the [JHipster code of conduct](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). One of our goals is to have inclusive logos: at the moment the "JHipster family" has a few members, but the idea is that this family grows, with many different members, as expressed in our code of conduct. If you want to help the project, you can either participate as an artist (the source files from all logos are available in this repository) or as a sponsor (so we can pay an artist to create those new logos).

All logos are validated by [Audrey Neveu](https://twitter.com/Audrey_Neveu), who is well-known in the Java community for her involvement in [Devoxx4Kids](http://www.devoxx4kids.org/) and [Duchess France](https://www.duchess-france.org/).

## Logo usage

All logos are available under the [Apache 2 license](LICENSE.txt), and belong the JHipster project.
